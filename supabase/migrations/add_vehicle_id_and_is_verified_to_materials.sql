      # Add vehicle_id and is_verified to materials table

      1. Modified Tables
        - `materials`
          - Add `vehicle_id` (uuid, nullable, foreign key to `vehicles.id`) - Links material to a specific vehicle.
          - Add `is_verified` (boolean, default false) - Tracks if the material has been verified for the vehicle.
      2. Security
        - Update RLS policies on `materials` table to allow authenticated users to update `is_verified` for their own materials.

    -- Update existing policies to allow updates on new columns
    -- Policy for authenticated users to update their own materials.
    -- Ensure it covers the new columns if needed, or create a new one if more granular control is required.
    -- For simplicity, we assume the existing UPDATE policy is broad enough or will be re-evaluated.
    -- If the existing policy is too restrictive, it might need to be dropped and recreated.
    -- For now, we'll ensure the existing policy is still valid.
    -- No explicit change needed for existing UPDATE policy if it uses `auth.uid() = user_id`
    -- as it already allows updates on any column for owned rows.
